<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Redeeming the time”</span> (Eph. v. 16).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two little words are found in the Greek
version here. They are translated
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">ton kairon</span></span>”</span> in the revised version,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Buying up for yourselves the opportunity.”</span>
The two words <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">ton kairon</span></span> mean, literally,
the opportunity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They do not refer to time in general, but to a
special point of time, a juncture, a crisis, a
moment full of possibilities and quickly passing
by, which we must seize and make the
best of before it has passed away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is intimated that there are not many such
moments of opportunity, because the days are
evil; like a barren desert, in which, here and
there, you find a flower, pluck it while you can;
like a business opportunity which comes a few
times in a life-time; buy it up while you have
the chance. Be spiritually alert; be not unwise,
but understanding what the will of God is.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
buying up for yourselves the opportunity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sometimes it is a moment of time to be
saved; sometimes a soul to be led to Christ;
sometimes it is an occasion for love; sometimes
for patience: sometimes for victory over temptation
and sin. Let us redeem it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will cause you to walk in My statutes”</span> (Eze. xxxvi.
27).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The highest spiritual condition is one
where life is spontaneous and flows
without effort, like the deep floods of
Ezekiel's river, where the struggles of
the swimmer ceased, and he was borne by the
current's resistless force.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So God leads us into spiritual conditions and
habits which become the spontaneous impulses
of our being, and we live and move in the fulness
of the divine life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But these spiritual habits are not the outcome
of some transitory impulse, but are often
slowly acquired and established. They begin,
like every true habit, in a definite act of will,
and they are confirmed by the repetition of that
act until it becomes a habit. The first stages
always involve effort and choice. We have to
take a stand and hold it steadily, and after we
have done so a certain time, it becomes second
nature, and carries us by its own force.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Holy Spirit is willing to form such habits
in every direction of our Christian life, and
if we will but obey Him in the first steppings
of faith, we will soon become established in
the attitude of obedience, and duty will be delight.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Watch and pray”</span> (Matt. xxvi. 41).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We need to watch for prayers as well
as for the answers to our prayers.
It needs as much wisdom to pray
rightly as it does faith to receive the
answers to our prayers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We met a friend the other day, who had been
in years of darkness because God had failed to
answer certain prayers, and the result had been
a state bordering on infidelity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A very few moments were sufficient to convince
this friend that these prayers had been
entirely unauthorized, and that God had never
promised to answer such prayers, and they
were for things which this friend should have
accomplished himself, in the exercise of ordinary
wisdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The result was deliverance from a cloud of
unbelief which was almost wrecking a Christian
life. There are some things about which
we do not need to pray, as much as to take the
light which God has already given.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many persons are asking God to give them
peculiar signs, tokens and supernatural intimations
of His will. Our business is to use
the light He has given, and then He will give
whatever more we need.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed is the man that walketh not”</span> (Ps. i. 1).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three things are notable about this
man:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. His company. <span class="tei tei-q">“He walketh not
in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in
the seat of the scornful.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. His reading and thinking. <span class="tei tei-q">“His delight
is in the law of the Lord, and in His law doth
he meditate day and night.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. His fruitfulness. <span class="tei tei-q">“And he shall be like
a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf
also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth
shall prosper.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The river is the Holy Ghost; the planting, the
deep, abiding life in which, not occasionally,
but habitually, we absorb the Holy Spirit; and
the fruit is not occasional, but continual, and
appropriate to each changing season.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His life is also prosperous, and his spirit
fresh, like the unfading leaf. Such a life must
be happy. Indeed, happiness is a matter of
spiritual conditions. Put a sunbeam in a cellar
and it must be bright. Put a nightingale in
the darkest midnight, and it must sing.

<span class="tei tei-q">“I know him that he will do the law”</span> (Gen. xviii. 19).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God wants people that He can depend
upon. He could say of Abraham, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
know him, that the Lord may bring
upon Abraham all that He hath spoken.”</span>
God can be depended upon; He wants us
to be just as decided, as reliable, as stable. This
is just what faith means. God is looking for
men on whom He can put the weight of all His
love, and power, and faithful promises. When
God finds such a soul there is nothing He will
not do for him. God's engines are strong enough
to draw any weight we attach to them. Unfortunately
the cable which we fasten to the
engine is often too weak to hold the weight of
our prayer, therefore God is drilling us, disciplining
us, and training us to stability and
certainty in the life of faith. Let us learn our
lessons, and let us stand fast.

We have a friend who has a phonograph
for his correspondence. It
consists of two parts. One is a
simple and wonderful apparatus,
whose sensitive cylinders receive the tones and
then give them out again, word for word,
through the hearing tube. The other part is a
common little box that stands under the table,
and does nothing but supply the power through
connecting wires.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, the little box might insist upon being
the phonograph, and doing the talking; but if
it should, it would not only waste its own life
but destroy the life of its partner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Its sole business is to supply power to the
phonograph, while the latter is to do the talking.
So some of us are called to be voices to
speak for God to our fellow-men, others are
forces to sustain them, by our holy sympathy
and silent prayer. (Some of us are little dynamos
under the table, while others are phonographs that speak
aloud the messages of heaven.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let each of us be true to our God-given
ministry, and when the day comes our work
will be weighed and the rewards distributed.

It is the little stumblings of life that most discourage

stumblings are over trifles. Satan would much
rather knock us down with a feather than with

It is henceforth no longer our will, but His

put into it all the strength and intensity of His

Christ has laid down a definite plan of work
for His Church, and He expects us to understand
it, and to work up to it; and as we catch

There is a beautiful touch of loving

it is added, <span class="tei tei-q">“When he came into the

him, as the old Saxon word means, by

He puts Himself first in the embarrassing need
and bears the heavy end of the burden for His
distressed and suffering child. He makes our
cares His cares, our sorrows His sorrows, our
shame His shame, and <span class="tei tei-q">“He is able to be
touched with the feeling of our infirmities.”</span>

An important help in the life of prayer
is the habit of bringing everything to

God meets the things that we commit to Him

to Him to be ineffectual, simply to remind
us of our dependence upon Him for
everything. It is very gracious and mindful of
Him thus gently to compel us to remember
Him and to hold us so close to Him that we

There is danger in becoming morbid
even in preparing for the Lord's coming.
We remember a time in our life
when we had devoted ourselves to
spend a month in waiting upon the Lord for a
baptism of the Holy Ghost, and before the end
of the month, the Lord shook us out of our
seclusion and compelled us to go out and carry
His message to others; and as we went, He met
us in the service.

life.

secondly, getting out of ourselves and living
for the help of others and the preparation of
the world for His appearing.

It is a great deliverance to lose one's self.
There is no heavier millstone that one
can be compelled to carry than self-consciousness.
It is so easy to get introverted
and coiled round one's self in our spiritual
consciousness. There is nothing that is
so easy to fasten on as our misery; there is
nothing that is more apt to produce self-consciousness
than suffering, until it becomes almost
a settled habit to hold on to our burden,
and pray it unceasingly into the very face of
God, until our very prayer saturates us with
our own misery, instead of asking for power to
drop ourselves altogether, and leave ourselves
in His loving hands and know that we are
free, and then rise into the blessed liberty of
His higher thoughts and will, and His love and
care for others.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The very act of letting go of ourselves really
lifts us into a higher plane, and relieves us from

for others, and especially for the world, brings
its own recompense, and leaves upon our
hearts a blessing like the fertility which the
Nile deposits upon the soil of Egypt, as it
flows through to its distant goal.

It is faith without sight. When we can

looks up and sails on, by God's great Sun, not

the helm. See how firmly he holds the rudder,
bearing against the wind, and holding her
steady to her position. Let him for a moment
relax his steady hold and the ship will fall
listlessly along the wind. The sails will flap,
the waves will toss the vessel at their will, and
all rest and power will have gone. It is the
fixed helm that brings the steadying power of
the wind. And so He has said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou wilt

One good counsel will suffice just now.
Stop praying so much for yourself;
begin to ask unselfish things, and see if

much easier it will be to believe for another

praying for the world, for definite things, for
difficult things, for glorious things, for things
that will honor Christ and save mankind, and
after you have received a few wonderful answers

souls they bring to Christ. Their labor
seems to crystallize and become its own memorial.
Others again seem to blend so wholly
with other workers that their own individuality
can scarcely be traced. And yet, after all, this
is the most Christ-like ministry of all, for the
Master Himself does not even appear in the
work of the church except as her hidden Life
and ascended Head, and even the Holy Spirit
is lost in the vessels that He uses. The vine
does not bear the fruit, and even the sap is unseen
in its ceaseless flow, and it is the little
branches which bear all the clusters and seem
to have all the honor of the vintage. And so
the nearer we come to Christ the more we are
willing to be lost sight of in our fruit, and let
others be more prominent, while we are the
glad and willing witnesses of our testimony
and hold up their hands by the silent ministry
of love and prayer. Lord, let me be like the

Operation after operation had only irritated

small but powerful magnet, which he kept before
the wounded eye, as close as it could
bear. Immediately the piece of steel began
to move toward the powerful attraction, and
soon flew up to meet it and left the suffering
eye completely relieved, without an effort or a

Satan is always trying to weaken our

What a rest it would be to many of
us if we could but exchange burdens
with Christ, and so utterly and forever
transfer to Him all our cares
and needs that we would not feel henceforth
responsible for our burdens, but know that He
has undertaken all the care, and that our faith
is simply to carry His burdens, and that He
prays, labors, and suffers only for us and our
interests. This is what He truly invites us to
do. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come unto Me,”</span> He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“all ye that labor
and are heavy-laden and I will rest you,”</span>
and then He adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take My yoke upon you,
and learn of Me.”</span> He takes our yoke and we
take His and we find it a thousand times easier
to carry one of His burdens than to carry our
own. How much more delightful it is to spend
an hour in supplication for another than five
minutes in pleading for ourselves. Are we not
weary of carrying our wretched loads?

We find Paul in the Epistles to the Philippians
expressing a sublime and holy indifference

The secret of Moses' failures was this:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The law made nothing perfect, but the
bringing in of a better hope did.”</span> And
this was why his life work also came
short of full realization. He saw but entered
not the Promised Land. The founder of the
law had to be its victim, and his life and death
might demonstrate the inability of the law to
lead any man into the Promised Land. The
very fact, that it was for so slight a fault that
Moses lost his inheritance, makes all the more
emphatic the solemn sentence of the law.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Cursed is every one that continueth not in

But to the glory of the grace of God we can
add that what the law could not do for Moses
the Gospel did; and he who could not pass

Transfiguration glory, and talking of that
death on Calvary to which be owed his glorious
destiny.

How can I take Christ as my Sanctifier,
or Healer? is a question that we are
constantly asked. It is necessary first
of all that we get into the posture of
faith. This has to be done by a definite and
voluntary act, and then maintained by a uniform
habit. It is just the same as the planting
of a tree. You must put it in the soil by a definite
act, and then you must let it stay put and
remain settled in the ground until the little
roots have time to fix themselves and begin to
draw the sustenance from the soil. There are
two stages, the definite planting and then the
habitual absorbing of moisture and nourishment
from the ground. The root fibers must
rest until they reach out their spongy pores
and drink in the nutriment of the earth. After
the habit is established, then by a certain uniform
law, the plant draws its life from the
ground without an effort, and it is just as natural
for it to grow as it is for us to breathe.

In taking Christ in any new relationship,
we must first have sufficient intellectual
light to satisfy our mind that we are entitled
to stand in this relationship. The
shadow of a question here will wreck our confidence.
Then, having seen this, we must make
the venture, the committal, the choice, and take
the place just as definitely as the tree is planted
in the soil, or the bride gives herself away at
the marriage altar. It must be once for all,
without reserve, without recall.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then there is a season of establishing, settling
and testing, during which we must stay
put until the new relationship gets so fixed as
to become a permanent habit. It is just the
same as when the surgeon sets the broken arm.
He puts it in splints to keep it from vibration.
So God has His spiritual splints that He wants
to put upon His children and keep them quiet

proposition to search out the land, and find out
by investigation whether God had told the

unbelief that shut the doors of Canaan to a

How many dear Christians are in the
place that the Lord has appointed
them, and yet the devil is harassing
their lives with a vague sense of not
quite pleasing the Lord. Could they just settle
down in the place that God has assigned
them and fill it sweetly and lovingly for Him
there would be more joy in their hearts and
more power in their lives. God wants us all in
various places, and the secret of accomplishing
the most for Him is to recognize our places
from Him and our service in it as pleasing
Him. In the great factory and machine there
is a place for the smallest screw and rivet as
well as the great driving wheel and piston, and
so God has His little screws whose business is
simply to stay where He puts them and to believe
that He wants them there and is making
the most of their lives in the little spaces that
they fill for Him.

there must be an election out of the election,

their prudence, caution and singleness of purpose,

and, with this little picked band, he raised the
standard against the Midianites, and through

and it carries with it a certain shadowy
fear that takes away the simple freedom
and gladness of life, but there is a rectitude,
and uprightness, a strictness of purpose, and of
conduct which cannot be gainsaid or questioned.

Precious souls sometimes fight tremendous
battles in order to attain to
righteousness in trying places. Perhaps
the heart has become wrong in some
matter where temptation has been allowed to
overcome, or at least to turn it aside from its
singleness unto God; and the conflict is a terrible
one as it seeks to adjust itself and be right
with God, and finds itself baffled by its own
spiritual foes, and its own helplessness, perplexity
and perversity. How dark and dreary
the struggle, and how helpless and ineffectual
it often seems at such times! It is almost sure
to strive in the spirit of the law, and the result
always is, and must ever be, condemnation and
failure. Every disobedience is met by a blow
of wrath, and discouragement, and it well nigh
sinks to despair. Oh, if the tempted and struggling
one could only understand or remember
what perhaps he has learned before, that Christ
is our righteousness, and that it is not by law
but by grace alone, <span class="tei tei-q">“For sin shall not have dominion

the skeleton without the flesh covering; it is

We shall never forget a remark Mr.
George Mueller once made in answer
to a gentleman who asked him the
best way to have strong faith. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
only way,”</span> replied the patriarch of faith, <span class="tei tei-q">“to
learn strong faith is to endure great trials. I
have learned my faith by standing firm amid
severe testings.”</span> This is very true. The time
to trust is when all else fails. Dear one, if you
scarcely realize the value of your present opportunity,
if you are passing through great afflictions,
you are in the very soul of the strongest
faith, and if you will only let go, He will
teach you in these hours the mightiest hold
upon this throne which you can ever know.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be not afraid, only believe”</span>; and if you are
afraid, just look up and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“What time I am
afraid, I will trust in Thee,”</span> and you will yet
thank God for the school of sorrow which was
to you the school of faith.

Goodness is a fruit of the Spirit.
Goodness is just <span class="tei tei-q">“Godness.”</span> It is to
be like God. And God-like goodness
has special reference to the active
benevolence of God. The apostle gives us the
difference between goodness and righteousness
in this passage in Romans, <span class="tei tei-q">“Scarcely for a
righteous man would one die, yet peradventure
for a good man some would even dare to die.”</span>
The righteous man is the man of stiff, inflexible
uprightness; but he may be as hard as a
granite mountain side. The good man is that
mountain side all covered with velvet moss and
flowers, and flowing with cascades and springs.
Goodness respects <span class="tei tei-q">“whatsoever things are
lovely.”</span> It is kindness, affectionateness, benevolence,
sympathy, rejoicing with them that
do rejoice, and weeping with them that weep.
Lord, fill us with Thyself, and let us be God-men
and good men, and so represent Thy goodness.

<span class="tei tei-q">“As we have many members in one body, so we being
many are one body in Christ”</span> (Rom. xii. 4, 5).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sometimes our communion with
God is cut off, or interrupted because
of something wrong with a brother, or
some lack of unity in the body of
Christ. We try to get at the Lord, but we cannot,
because we are separated from some member
of the Lord's body, or because there is
not the freedom of His love flowing through
every organic part. It does not need a blow
upon the head to paralyze the brain; a blow
upon some nerve may do it; or a wound in
some artery at the extremities may be fatal to
the heart. Therefore we must stand right with
all His children, and meet in the body of Christ
in the sweetest, fullest fellowship, if we would
keep our perfect communion with Christ Himself.
Sometimes we will find that an altered attitude
to one Christian will bring us into
the flood-tides of the Holy Ghost. It
seems impossible to have faith without
love, or to have Christ alone without the fulness
of fellowship with all His dear saints;
and if one member suffer, all suffer together,
and if one rejoice, all are blessed in common.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The hand of Gehazi, and even the staff
of Elisha could not heal the lifeless
boy. It needed the living touch of the
prophet's own divinely quickened
flesh to infuse vitality into the cold clay. Lip to
lip, hand to hand, heart to heart, he must touch
the child ere life could thrill his pulseless veins.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must come into personal contact with
the risen Saviour, and have His very life quicken
our mortal flesh before we can know the
fulness and reality of His healing. This is the
most frequent cause of failure. People are
often trusting to something that has been done
to them, to something that they have done, or
something that they have believed intellectually;
but their spirit has not felt its way to the
heart of Christ, and they have not drawn His
love into their being by the hunger and thirst
of love and faith, and so they are not quickened.
The greatest need of our souls and bodies
is to know Jesus personally, to touch Him
constantly, to abide in Him continually.

to quiet. Sick one, begin to rejoice in the
Lord, and your bones will flourish like an herb,
and your cheeks will glow with the bloom of
health and freshness. Worry, fear, distrust,
care, are all poison drops; joy is balm and healing;
and if you will but rejoice, God will give
power. He has commanded you to be glad and
rejoice; and He never fails to sustain His children
in keeping His commandments. Rejoice
in the Lord always, He says; which means no
matter how sad, how tempted, how sick, how
suffering you are, rejoice in the Lord just
where you are, and begin this moment.

Temperance is true self-government.
It involves the grace of self-denial and
the spirit of a sound mind. It is that
poise of spirit that holds us quiet, self-possessed,
recollected, deliberate, and subject
ever to the voice of God and the conviction of
duty in every step we take. Many persons have
not that poise and recollected spirit. They are
drifting at the impulse of their own impressions,
moods, the influence of others, or the
circumstances around them. No desire should
ever control us. No purpose, however right,
should have such mastery over us that we are
not perfectly free. The pure affection may be
an inordinate affection. Our work itself may
be a selfish passion. That thing that we began
to do because it was God's will, we may cling
to and persist in ultimately, because it is our
own will. Lord, give us the spirit ever controlled
by Thy Spirit and will, and the eye
that looks to Thee every moment as the eyes
of a servant to the hands of her mistress. So
shall Thy service be our perfect freedom, and
our subjection divinest liberty.

It is easy for water to run down from the
upper springs, but it requires a divine
impulse to flow up from the valley in the
nether springs. There is nothing that
tells more of Christ than to see a Christian rejoicing

as they swing their loads, keeping time
with the spirit of praise to the footsteps and
movements of labor and duty. No one has a

business man or a serving woman who can
carry the light of heaven in their faces all day

drop adhering to its burnished breast and

This is the secret of the deeper life, but

sweetness of it. The fulness of the
divine love in the heart will make everything
easy. It is very easy to do things that we love

we love, and the more we realize their love the
more we will trust them for it. It is the source
of healing. The tide of love flowing through
our bodies will strangely strengthen our very
frame, and the love of our Lord will become a
continual spring of youth and freshness in our
physical being. The secret of love is very
simple. It is to take the heart of Jesus for our
love and claim its love for every need of life,
whether it be toward God or toward others.
It is very sweet to think of persons in this way,
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will take the heart of Jesus toward them, to

Often we want people to pray for us
and help us, but always defeat our object
when we look too much to them
and lean upon them. The true secret
of union is for both to look upon God, and in
the act of looking past themselves to Him they
are unconsciously united. The sailor was
right when he saw the little boy fall overboard
and waited a minute before he plunged to his
rescue. When the distracted mother asked
him in agony why he had waited so long, he
sensibly replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“I knew that if I went in
before he would clutch and drag me down. I
waited until his struggles were over, and then
I was able to help him when he did not grasp
me too strongly.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When people grasp us too strongly, either
with their love or with their dependence, we
are intuitively conscious that they are not
looking to God, and we become paralyzed in
our efforts to help them. United prayer, therefore,
requires that the one for whom we pray
be looking away from us to the Lord Jesus
Christ, and we together look to Him alone.

we prayed with her, committing her case
to the Lord for absolute trust and deliverance
as she was prepared to claim. As soon as we
closed our prayer she grasped our hand, and
asked us to unite with her in the burden that
was most upon her heart, and then, without a
word of reference to her own healing, or the
burden under which she was being crushed to
death, she burst into such a prayer for a poor
orphan boy, of whom she had just heard that
day, as we have never heard surpassed for
sympathy and love, imploring God to help him
and save him, and sobbing in spasmodic agony
of love many times during her prayer, and
then she ceased without even referring to her

steady it when trembling and shaking as the

touched God's work presumptuously, and they
fell paralyzed and lifeless. Much of the life of
faith consists in letting things alone. If we
wholly trust an interest to God we can keep
our hands off it, and He will guard it for us
better than we can help Him. <span class="tei tei-q">“Rest in the

thyself in any wise because of him that prospereth

seem to be going all wrong, but He knows as
well as we; and He will arise in the right
moment if we are really trusting Him so fully
as to let Him work in His own way and time.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beautiful is the expression in the
Book of Isaiah which reflects with exceeding
sweetness the love of our dear
Lord. He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“They are My people,
children that will not lie; so He was their Saviour.”</span>
They did lie, but He would not believe
it. At least He speaks as if He would
not believe it in the greatness of His love, because
they were His people. He has not seen
iniquity in Jacob nor perversity in Israel.
There is plenty of it to see, and the devil sees
it all, and a good many people are only too glad
to see it; but the dear Father will not see it.
He covers it with His love and the precious
blood of His dear atoning Son. Such a wonderful
love ought surely to make us gentler to
others, and more anxious to cause our Father
less need to hide His loving eyes from our imperfections
and faults.

we shall clothe even the world with those

from every conflicting thought and look steadily
up to Jesus. But if we desire the gratification
of our impulse more than His Presence,
we will yield to the passionate word or the frivolous

how he tripped you over an orange

some great blessing in our lives, he generally
throws some ugly shadow over it and makes it
look distasteful to us. How many of us have

Calvary and the open grave of the Easter
morning. We see it in every deep spiritual life.
Every true life is death-born, and the deeper
the dying the truer the living. We doubt not

us all many a place where there ought to be a
grave, and many a lingering shred of the natural
and sinful which we would gladly lay
down in a bottomless grave. God help us to
pass the irrevocable sentence of death and to

themselves for years, and have not had the
courage to strike the fatal blow. Oh, if they
would just put themselves at Jesus' feet, and
let Him do it, there would be accomplishment
and rest. On that cross He has provided for
our death as well as our life, and our part is
just to let His death be applied to our nature
just as it has been to our old sins, and then
leave it with Him, think no more about it, and
count it dead, not recognizing it any longer as
ourselves, but another, refusing to listen or
fear it, to be identified with it, or even try to
cleanse it, but counting it utterly in His hands,

it would be to begin next week and cut it

revive and nourish it into life. Its business is
not to die, but to live. So, we thought, it is
with the discipline of the soul. It, too, has its
dying hour; but it must not be always dying:
Rather reckon ourselves to be dead indeed unto
sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Death is but a moment. Live, then,
ye children of the resurrection, on His glorious

are two cares in this verse—your care and His
care. They are different in the original. One
means anxious care, the other means Almighty
care. Cast your anxious care on Him and take
His Almighty care instead. Make no account

You cannot make the heart restful by
stopping its beating. Belladonna will
do that, but that is not rest. Let the
breath of life come—God's life and
strength—and there will be sweet rest. Home
ties and family affection will not bring it. Deliverance
from trouble will not bring it. Many
a tried heart has said: <span class="tei tei-q">“If this great trouble
was only gone, I should have rest.”</span> But as
soon as one goes another comes. The poor,
wounded deer on the mountain side, thinks if
he could only bathe in the old mountain stream
he would have rest. But the arrow is in its
flesh and there is no rest for it till the wound
is healed. It is as sore in the mountain lake
as on the plain. We shall never have God's
rest and peace in the heart till we have given
everything up to Christ—even our work—and
believe He has taken it all, and we have only
to keep still and trust. It is necessary to walk
in holy obedience and let Him have the government
on His shoulder. Paul said this: <span class="tei tei-q">“This

us all—Christ's will and work for us.

One of the hardest things for a lofty
and superior nature is to be under authority,
to renounce his own will, and
to take a place of subjection. But
Christ took upon Him the form of a servant,
gave up His independence, His right to please
Himself, His liberty of choice, and after having
from eternal ages known only to command,
gave Himself up only to obey. I have seen occasionally
the man who was once a wealthy
employer a clerk in the same store. It was not
an easy or graceful position, I assure you. But
Jesus was such a perfect servant that His
Father said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, My Servant in whom
My soul delighteth.”</span> All His life His watchword
was, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Son of Man came to minister.”</span>

to death, and also shame, the death of crucifixion.
This last was the consummation of
His love.

You will never get a humble heart until
it is born from above, from the heart
of Christ. For man has lost his own
humanity and alas, too often has a
demon heart. God wants us, as Christians, to
be simple, human, approachable and childlike.
The Christians that we know and love best, and
that are nearest to the Lord, are the most simple.
Whenever we grow stilted we are only fit
for a picture gallery, and we are only good on
a pedestal; but, if we are going to live among
men and love and save them, we must be approachable
and human. All stiffness is but
another form of self-consciousness. Ask Christ
for a human heart, for a smile that will be as
natural as your little child's in your presence.
Oh, how much Christ did by little touches!
He never would have got at the woman of
Samaria if He had come to her as the prophet.
He sat down, a tired man, and said:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Give me a drink of water.”</span> And so, all

Here is the very core of spiritual life. It

There must be a constant looking unto

an off-looking upon Jesus; that is,
looking off from the evil, refusing to
see it, not letting the mind dwell upon it for a
second. We should have mental eyelashes as
well as physical ones, which can be used like
shields, and let no evil thing in; or, like a
stockade camp in the woods, which repels the
first assault of the enemy. This is the use of
the fringes to our eyes, and so it should be with
the soul. Many do not seem to know that they
have spiritual eyes. They go through the
world as if somebody had cut off their eyelashes,
and they stare away on the good and
evil alike. The devil comes along with his
evil pictures and bids them look. We cannot
look upon evil without being defiled. Sometimes,
in going down the street, the sight of
some of the pictures on the way will cast their
filth upon the soul so that we shall feel the need
of being bathed in Jesus' blood for hours for
cleansing. There has been no consent unto sin,
but the sight of it has defiled. There is no
help for it but in the resolute, steady, inner
view of Christ.

conversion. I do not think it necessary for a

good in ourselves; but, oh, are we also conscious
of His great goodness? We may be
ready to admit our own disability, but are we
as ready to admit His ability? There are many
Christians who can say, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are not sufficient
of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves”</span>;

who can say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Our sufficiency is of God.”</span>

Are you sure that He is able to provide every
want in you, or do you feel that you must supply
it yourself? Are you believing that God
does now supply every lack in your heart and
your life, so that all stumbling is taken
away, and you are endowed with power for His
service, as Elisha took the empty vessels and
filled them before they were set aside to be
used? Our Saviour, at Cana, ordered the
water-pots to be filled to the brim. Then the
water was made into wine, but not until the
vessels were full. God wants His children to
have always a full heart.

pains with those who are to be of much use to
Him. There is a nature in them that needs

corn is treated with the wise, discriminating
care that will fit it for food. He knows the
way He is taking, and there is infinite tenderness
in the oversight He gives. He is watching
the furnace you are in lest the heat should
be too intense. He wants it great enough to
purify, and then it is withdrawn. He knoweth
our frame. He will not let any temptation
take us but such as is common to man, and He
will with the temptation also make a way to
escape, that we may be able to bear it. Do you

Christ makes no less of our trust for
temporal things than He does for
spiritual things. He places a good
deal of emphasis upon it. Why? Simply
because it is harder to trust God for them.
In spiritual matters we can fool ourselves, and
think that we are trusting when we are not;
but we cannot do so about rent and food, and
the needs of our body. They must come or
our faith fails. It is easy to say that we trust
Him in things that are a long way off, but there
can be no trifling about it in things where the
faith must bring practical answers. It is easy
to have faith for our needs, and to trust Him
when the sun is shining. But let some things
arise which irritate and rasp and fret us, and
we soon find whether we have real trust or not.
And so the things of everyday life are tests of
our real faith in God, and He often puts us
where we have to trust for tangible matters—for
money and rent, and food and clothes. If
you are not trusting here wholly, when you
are placed in such tests you will break down.
Are you trusting God for everything through
the six ordinary days of the week?

There shall not a single thing come

able to see the King in His beauty. Let us be
very sure that we do not see anything else.
Our pupils will become impressed as they look

Life is very largely made up of words.
They are not so emphatic, perhaps, as
deeds. Deeds are more deliberate expressions
of thought. One of the most
remarkable authors of the New Testament has
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If any man offend not in word, the same
is a perfect man.”</span> It is very often a test of
victory in Christian life. Our triumph in this
often depends on what we say, or what we do
not say. It is said by James of the tongue, <span class="tei tei-q">“It
is set on fire of hell.”</span> The true Christian,
therefore, is righteous in his ways and upright
in his words. His deeds appeal to men; but in
speech he is looking up, for God is listening.
His words are sent upward and recorded for
the judgment. I believe that this is an actual
fact, and I can almost fancy that the skies
above, which seem so transparent, the beautiful
blue ether over our heads, is like a waxen tablet
with a finely sensitive surface, and receives
an impression of every word we speak, and that
then these tablets are hardened and preserved
for the eternal judgment. So we should speak,
dear friends, with our eyes ever upward, never
forgetting that we shall some day meet the
words that we have spoken.

nothing rich in its outside appearance. The
costly things were all within, and its outward
covering of rough badger skin gave no hint of
the valuable things which it contained. God
may send you, dear friends, some costly packages.
Do not worry if they are done up in
rough wrappings. You may be sure there are
treasures of love, and kindness and wisdom
hidden within. Do not be so foolish as

Many Christians have orchards full of fruit,

There is a great deal in them that is good, but

something goes wrong in your domestic

When work is pressing there are many

faith in God. A desperate desire to get some
difficulty right takes the eye off of God and
His glory. Some dear ones have been so anxious

God loved the place where His ancient temple
rose in majesty was because there Abraham
offered his son and David his treasure. The
reason redemption is so dear to the Father and
the heavenly world is because its foundation-stone
is the Cross of Calvary. And the Christian
life that is dearest to the heart of God, and

called to the knowledge and service of Christ
through this providential meeting. Had he not
been a working man, and pursuing his ordinary
avocation he would not have been brought into
contact with the apostle. It was in the line of
their calling, their common duties, and the
providential changes of their life that God
called them. And so He meets us. Do not
try hard to run away from it, but, as the
apostle has so finely put it, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let every
man abide in the same calling wherein he is
called, let him therein abide with God.”</span>

For Paul every exercise of the Christian
life was simply the grace of Jesus

by him, so that holiness was to put on
the Lord Jesus and all the robes of His perfect
righteousness which he loves to describe so

love which is the bond of perfectness.”</span> None
of these things are regarded as intrinsic qualities
in us, but as imparted graces from the
hand of Jesus. And even in the later years of
his life, and after the mature experience of a

<span class="tei tei-q">“I count all things but loss for the excellency

Every victor must first be a self-conqueror.
But the method of Joshua's
victory was the uplifted arm of Moses

Amalek prevailed. It was to be a battle of
faith and not of human strength, and the banner
that was to wave over the discomfited foe,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah-nissi.”</span> This, too, is the secret of our

Have we thus begun the battle and in the
strength of Christ planted our feet on our own
necks, and thus victorious over the enemy in
the citadel of the heart been set at liberty for
the battle of the Lord and the service of others?
It was the lack of this that hindered the life
of Saul and it has wrecked many a promising
career. One enemy in the heart is stronger
than ten thousand in the field. May the Lord
lead us all into Joshua's first triumph, and show
us the secret of self-crucifixion through the
greater Joshua, who alone can lead us on to
holiness and victory!

4. An elevation, improvement and quickening

Christ.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

as the mind and soul.

6. An ability to pray the prayer of the Holy

around us. There is a divine harmony between
the Spirit and Providence.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ascension is more than resurrection.
Much is said of it in the New Testament.
Christ riseth above all things.
We see Him in the very act of ascending
as we do not in the actual resurrection,
as, with hands and lips engaged in blessing,
He gently parts from their side, so simply,
so unostentatiously, with so little imposing
ceremony as to make heaven so near to our
common life that we can just whisper through.
And we, too, must ascend, even here. <span class="tei tei-q">“If ye
then be risen with Christ, seek those things
that are above.”</span> We must learn to live on
the heaven side and look at things from above.
How it overcomes sin, defies Satan, dissolves
perplexities, lifts us above trials, separates us
from the world and conquers the fear of death
to contemplate all things as God sees them, as
Christ beholds them, as we shall one day look
back upon them from His glory, and as if we
were now really <span class="tei tei-q">“Seated with Him,”</span> as indeed
we are, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the heavenly places.”</span> Let us arise
with His resurrection and in fellowship with
His glorious ascension learn henceforth to live
above.

Yes, our perplexities would become plain
if we kept on a spiritual elevation. How
often when the traveler quite loses his
way he can soon find it again from
some tree top or some hill top where all the
winding paths he has gone spread behind him,
and the whole homeward road opens before.
So, from the heights of prayer and faith, we too
can see the plain path, and know that we are
going home.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is no other way in which we can gain
the victory over the world. We must get
above it. We must see it from the side of our
great reward. Then it looks like earthly objects
after we have gazed upon the sun for a
while. We are blind to them. When the
Italian fruit-seller finds that he is heir to a
ducal palace you cannot tempt him any more
with the paltry profits of his trade or the company
of his old associates. He is above it all.
They who know the hope of their calling and
the riches of the glory of their inheritance can
well despise the world. It is the poor starving
ones who go hungering for the husks of earth.
We are born from above and have a longing to
go home. Let us go forth to-day with our
hearts on the homestretch.

In sanctification what becomes of the old
nature? Many people are somewhat unduly
concerned to know if it can be
killed outright, and seem to desire a sort
of certificate of its death and burial. It is
enough to know that it is without and Christ
is within. It may show itself again, and even
knock at the door and plead for admittance,
but it is forever outside while we abide in Him.
Should we step out of Him and into sin we
might find the old corpse in the ghastly cemetery,
and its foul aroma might yet revive and
embrace us once more. But he that abideth
in Him sinneth not and cannot sin while he so
abides.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore let us abide and let us not be anxious
to escape the hold of eternal vigilance and
ceaseless abiding. Our paths are made and the
strength to pursue them; let us walk in them.
God has provided for us a full sanctification.
Is it strange that He should demand it of us,
and require us to be holy, even as He is holy,
seeing He has given us His own holiness. So
let us put on our beautiful garments and prepare
to walk in white with Him.

prepared, to be broken up by ploughing, to be
mellowed by harrowing, all the stones removed,
the roots of all natural growth dug up,
for the good things we are seeking are not natural
growths and will not grow in our soil.
We all start on the old basis and try to improve
the old nature, but that is not God's way. His
way is to get self out of the way entirely, and
let Him create anew out of nothing, so that all
shall be of Him; and we must find Jesus the
Alpha and Omega.

Grace literally means that which we
do not have to earn. It has two great
senses always; it comes for nothing
and it comes when we are helpless; it
doesn't merely help the man that helps himself—that
is not the Gospel; the Gospel is that
God helps the man who can't help himself.
And then there is another thing; God helps the
man to help himself, for everything the man
does comes from God. Grace is given to the
man who is so weak and helpless he cannot
take the first step. That is the meaning of
grace—a little of the meaning of it; we can
never know the fulness it has. Now, this river
is as free as it is full, but you know some people
have an idea when they get a little farther
on they have got to pay an admission, and reserved
seats are very high, and they shrink
back from the higher blessings of the Gospel;
ordinary Christians scarcely dare to claim
them. If I understand the meaning of this,
God has not put the higher blessings apart for
a separate class who somehow are nearer to
Him. God is no respecter of persons.

Your load, though heavy for you, is not heavy

shoulder, not two shoulders. The government
of the world is upon His shoulder. He is not

different foundation—we are building on something
in ourselves. Always take grace as
something you don't deserve, something that is
freely bestowed. The long, deep, boundless
river is free; it is as free at the mouth as it is
at the little stream, and free all the way along,
and anybody can come and drink, and anybody

prayer and abiding communion. Let

Let us reach persons this day we cannot reach
in person; let us expect results that we have
never dared to claim before; let us count every

great and mighty things which we know not.

And as we thus claim Him we will find His
grace sufficient for us, and begin to learn that
giving all is just receiving all. Yes, consecration
is getting Him fully instead of our own
miserable life. There are, indeed, two sides of
it. There are two persons in the consecration.
One of them is the dear Lord Himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“And
for their sakes,”</span> He says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I consecrate Myself
that they also might be consecrated through

to Him He consecrates Himself to us,

First in order to a consecrated life
there must be a sense of need, the need
of purity, of power, and of a greater
nearness to the Lord. There often
comes in Christian life a second conviction. It
is not now a sense of guilt and God's wrath so
much as of the power and evil of inward sin,
and the unsatisfactoriness of the life the soul
is living. It usually comes from the deeper
revelation of God's truth, from more spiritual
teaching, from definite examples and testimonies
of this life in others, and often from an experience
of deep trial, conflict and temptation
in which the soul has found its attainments
and resources inadequate for the real issues
and needs of life. The first result is often a
deep discouragement and even despair, but the
valley of Achor is the door of hope, and the
seventh chapter of Romans with its bitter cry,
<span class="tei tei-q">“O wretched man that I am,”</span> is the gateway
to the eighth with its shout of triumph, <span class="tei tei-q">“The

We must recognize the true character

Usually the crisis of life in such cases hangs
upon a single point. God does not need to
strike us in a hundred places to inflict a death
wound. There is one point that touches the
heart, and that is the point God usually strikes,
the dearest thing in our life, the decisive thing
in our plans, the citadel of the will, the center
of the heart, and when we yield there, there is
little left to yield anywhere else, and when we
refuse to yield at this point, a spirit of evasion
and compromise enters into all the rest of our
life. Lord, we take Thee to enable us to will
Thy will to be done in all things in our life
without and within.

the most entire dependence and the most complete
possession of the Holy Spirit. Therefore,
the beautiful act of Christ in breathing

There is a beautiful fact in nature which has
its spiritual parallels. There is no music so
heavenly as an Aeolian harp, and the Aeolian
harp is nothing but a set of musical cords arranged
in harmony, and then left to be touched

<span class="tei tei-q">“Be like the dove”</span> (Jer. xlviii. 28).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Harmless as a dove, is Christ's interpretation
of the beautiful emblem.
And so the Spirit of God is purity itself.
He cannot dwell in an unclean
heart. He cannot abide in the natural mind.
It was said of the anointing of old, <span class="tei tei-q">“On man's
flesh it shall not be poured.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The purity which the Holy Spirit brings is
like the white and spotless little plant which
grows up out of the heap of manure, or the
black soil, without one grain of impurity adhering
to its crystalline surface, spotless as an
angel's wing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So the Holy Spirit gives a purity of heart
which gives its own protection, for it is essentially
unlike the evil things which grow
around it. It may be surrounded on every side
with evil, but it is uncontaminated and pure
because its very nature is essentially holy and
divine. Like the plumage of the dove, it cannot
be soiled, but comes forth from the miry
pool unstained and unsullied by the dark waters,
because it is protected by the oily covering
which sheds off every defilement and
makes it proof against the touch of every stain.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As any evil comes up, and the consciousness
of any unholy thing
touches our inner senses, it is our
privilege at once to hand it over to the
Holy Ghost and to lay it upon Jesus, as something
already crucified with Him, and as of
old, in the case of the sin offering, it will be
carried without the camp and burned to ashes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There may be deep suffering, there may be
protracted pain, it may be intensely real; but
throughout all there will be a very sweet and
sacred sense of God's presence, and intense
purity in our whole spirit, and our separation
from the evil which is being consumed. Truly,
it will be borne without the camp, and even
without the smell of the flames upon our garments.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is so blessed to have the Holy Spirit slay

There is nothing that glorifies God so much

weak, irresolute, selfish, and sinful, transformed
into sweetness, purity, power and standing
victorious amid circumstances from which its
natural qualities must utterly unfit it. A mind

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God has often to bring us not only into
the place of suffering, and the bed of
sickness and pain, but also into the
place where our righteousness breaks
down and our character falls to pieces, in order
to humble us in the dust and show us the need
of entire crucifixion to all our natural life.
Then, at the feet of Jesus we are ready to receive
Him, to abide in Him and depend upon
Him alone, and draw all our life and strength
each moment from Him, our Living Head.

more perfectly to Christ.

the strength of our own self-confidence?

We begin life with the natural, next we come
into the spiritual; but then, when we have
truly received the kingdom of God and His
righteousness, the natural is added to the spiritual,
and we are able to receive the gifts of
His providence and the blessings of life without
becoming centered in them or allowing
them to separate us from Him.

One of the greatest hindrances to spirituality
is the lack of waiting upon
God. You cannot go through twenty-four
hours with two or three breaths
of air, in the morning, as you sip your coffee.
But you must live in the atmosphere, and you
must breathe it all day long. Christians do
not wait upon God enough. It needs hours
and hours daily of spiritual communion with
the Holy Spirit to keep your vitality healthful
and full. Every moment should find you
breathing out yourself into Christ, and breathing
afresh His life, and love and power.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The beautiful figure suggested by this
passage is full of simple instruction.
It is as easy to receive the Holy Ghost
as it is to breathe. It almost seems as
if the Lord had given them the very impression
of breathing, and had said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, this is the
way to receive the Holy Ghost.”</span>

It is not necessary for you to go to a smallpox
hospital to have your lungs contaminated

in your lungs the air you inhaled a minute ago

have been absorbed from it, and there is nothing
left but carbon and other deadly gases and
fluids.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore, if you are to be filled with the
Holy Spirit, you must first get emptied not
only of your old sinful life, but of your old spiritual
life. You must get a new breath every
moment, or you will die. God wants you to
empty out all your being into Him, and then
you will take Him in, without needing to try
too hard. A vacuum always gets filled, an
empty pair of lungs unavoidably breathes in
the pure air. If you are only in the true attitude,
there will be no trouble about receiving
the Holy Ghost.

There is no spiritual value in depression.
One bright and thankful look
at the cross is worth a thousand morbid,
self-condemning reflections. The
longer you look at evil the more it mesmerizes
and defiles you into its own likeness. Lay it
down at the cross, accept the cleansing blood,
reckon yourself dead to the thing that was
wrong, and then rise up and count yourself as
if you were another man and no longer the
same person; and then, identifying yourself
with the Lord Jesus, accept your standing in
Him and look in your Father's face as blameless
as Jesus. Then out of your every fault will
come some lesson of watchfulness or some secret
of victory which will enable you some day
to thank Him, even for your painful experience.

The secret of joy is not to wait until you
feel happy, but to rise, by an act of
faith, out of the depression which is
dragging you down, and begin to
praise God as an act of choice. This is the
meaning of such passages as these: <span class="tei tei-q">“Rejoice
in the Lord alway, and again I say, rejoice”</span>;
<span class="tei tei-q">“I do rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Count
it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.”</span>

with sadness and then the triumphs of faith
and praise.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, this is what is meant—in part, at least—by
the sacrifice of praise. A sacrifice is that
which costs us something. And when a man
or woman has some cherished grudge or wrong
and is harboring it, nursing it, dwelling on it,
rolling it as a sweet morsel under the tongue,
and quite determined to enjoy a miserable time
in selfish morbidness and grumbling, it costs us
no little sacrifice to throw off the morbid spell,
to refuse the suggestions of injury, neglect and
the remembrance of unkindness, to rise out of
the mood of self-commiseration in wholesome
and holy determination, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will rejoice
in the Lord”</span>; I will <span class="tei tei-q">“count it all joy.”</span>

stepped out with the assurance that you have
died to self and sin, may be greatly amazed to
find yourself assailed with a tempest of
thoughts and feelings that seem to come wholly
from within and you will be impelled to
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, I thought I was dead, but I seem to
be alive.”</span> This, beloved, is the time to remember
that temptation, the instigation, is not sin,
but only of the evil one.

It is most cheering thus to know that although
we err and bring upon ourselves
many troubles that might have been
easily averted, yet God does not forsake
even His mistaken child, but on his humble repentance
and supplication is ever really both to
pardon and deliver. Let us not give up our
faith because we have perhaps stepped out of
the path in which He would have led us. The
Israelites did not follow when He called them
into the Land of Promise, yet God did not
desert them; but during the forty years of
their wandering He walked by their side bearing
their backsliding with patient compassion,
and waiting to be gracious unto them when
another generation should have come. <span class="tei tei-q">“In all
their afflictions He was afflicted, but the Angel
of His presence saved them; He bare them and

It must spring, of course, from faith.
There must be the full confidence that we are

over a precipice, or surrendering ourselves

Especially is this so when there

his horse needed to be reshod. Prudence
seemed to urge him without delay, but higher
wisdom taught him to halt a few minutes at the
blacksmith's forge by the way to have the shoe
replaced, and although he heard the feet of his
pursuers galloping hard behind, yet he waited
those minutes until his charger was refitted for
his flight, and then, leaping into his saddle just
as they appeared a hundred yards away, he
dashed away from them with the fleetness of

It is very reasonable that God should expect

practical enough to bring us temporal
relief, how can we be educated for real dependence

risk? It is all very well to talk about
trusting God for the distant and future prospect
of salvation after death! There is scarcely
a sinner in a Christian land that does not trust
to be saved some day, but there is no grasp in
faith like this. It is only when we come face
to face with positive issues and overwhelming
forces that we can prove the reality of Divine
power in a supernatural life. Hence as an education
to our very spirits as well as a gracious
provision for our temporal life, God has
trained His people from the beginning to recognize
Him as the supply of all their needs, and
to look to Him as the Physician of their bodies
and Father of their spirits. Beloved, have you

God uses trouble to teach His children precious
lessons. They are intended to educate
us. When their good work is done a glorious
recompense will come to us through them.
There is a sweet joy and opportunity in them.
He does not regard them as difficulties but as
opportunities. They have come to give
God a greater interest in you, and to show
how He can deliver you from them. We
cannot have a mercy worth praising God for
without difficulty. God is as deep, and
long, and high, as our little world of circumstances.

It would be a heaven of rest

every difficult situation as one of God's

power, and if instead of calculating upon defeat
we should begin to look around for the
messages of His glorious manifestations. Then
indeed would every cloud become a rainbow,
and every mountain a path of ascension and a
scene of transfiguration. If we will look upon
the past, many of us will find that the very
time our heavenly Father has chosen to do
the kindest things for us and give us the richest
blessings has been the time when we were
strained and shut in on every side. God's jewels
are often sent us in rough packages and by
dark liveried servants, but within we find the

The dove is in the cleft of the rock—the
riven side of our Lord. There is comfort
and security there. It is also in
the secret places of the stairs. It loves
to build its nest in the high towers to which
men mount the winding stairs for hundreds of
feet above the ground. What a glorious vision
is there obtained of the surrounding scenery.
It is a picture of ascending life. To reach its
highest altitudes we must find the secret places
of the stairs. That is the only way to rise
above the natural plane. Our life should be
one of quiet mounting with occasional resting
places; but we should be mounting higher step
by step. Everybody does not find this way of
secret ascent. It is for God's chosen ones. The
world may think you are going down. You
may not have as much public work to do as

And He will read over again this old marked
Bible with us, He will show us how He kept
all these promises, He will explain to us the
mysteries that we could not understand, He
will recall to our memory the things we have
long forgotten, He will go over again with us
the book of life, He will recall all the finished
story, and I am sure we will often cry: <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed
Christ! you have been so true, you have been
so good! Was there ever love like this?”</span> And
then the great chorus will be repeated once
more—<span class="tei tei-q">“There failed not aught of any good
thing that He hath spoken; all came to pass.”</span>

The Holy Spirit is the only one who can
kill us and keep us dead. Many Christians
try to do this disagreeable work
themselves, and they are going through
a continual crucifixion, but they can never accomplish
the work permanently. This is the
work of the Holy Spirit, and when you really
yield yourself to the death, it is delightful to
find how sweetly He can slay you.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the touch of the electric spark they tell
us life is extinguished almost without a quiver
of pain. But, however this may be in natural
things, we know the Holy Spirit can touch
with celestial fire the surrendered thing, and
slay it in a moment, after it is really yielded
up to the sentence of death. That is our business,
and it is God's business to execute that
sentence, and to keep it constantly operative.

Don't let us live in the pain of perpetual and
ineffectual suicide, but reckoning ourselves
dead indeed, let us leave ourselves in the hands
of the blessed Holy Spirit, and He will slay
whatever rises in opposition to His will, and
keep us true to our heavenly reckoning, and
filled with His resurrection life.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Holy Spirit becomes to the consecrated
heart the Spirit of intercession.
We have two Advocates. We have an
Advocate with the Father, who prays
for us at God's right hand; but the Holy Spirit
is the Advocate within, who prays in us, inspiring
our petitions and presenting them, through
Christ, to God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We need this Advocate. We know not what
to pray for, and we know not how to pray as
we ought, but He breathes in the holy heart
the desires that we may not always understand,
the groanings which we could not utter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But God understands, and He, with a loving
Father's heart, is always searching our hearts
to find the Spirit's prayer, and to answer it.
He finds many a prayer there that we have not
discovered, and answers many a cry that we
never understood. And when we reach our
home and read the records of life, we shall better
know and appreciate the infinite love of
that Divine Friend, who has watched within
as the Spirit of prayer, and breathed out our
every need to the heart of God.

The life of Jesus Christ brought into our
heart by the Holy Spirit, operates
there as a new law of divine strength
and vitality, and counteracts, overcomes
and lifts us above the old law of sin and
death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us illustrate these two laws by a simple
comparison. Look at my hand. By the law of
gravitation it naturally falls upon the desk and
lies there, attracted downward by that natural
law which makes heavy bodies fall to the
earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But there is a stronger law than the law of
gravitation—my own life and will. And so
through the operation of this higher law—the
law of vitality—I defy the law of gravitation,
and lift my hand and hold it above its former
resting-place, and move it at my will. The law
of vitality has made me free from the law of
gravitation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Precisely so the indwelling life of Christ Jesus,
operating with the power of a law, lifts
me above, and counteracts the power of sin in
my fallen nature.

You may train it by the most approved methods,

Faith is a receiving, or still better, a taking

taking.

The real secret of Abraham's whole life was
that he was the friend of God, and knew God

upon an unknown pathway with none but God.

We are told that Abraham glorified God by
this life of faith. The true way to glorify God

humble instruments through whom He can be

There he lies, unable to strike a blow, or

Now this is the position that God wants to

In the great parable in the fourteenth

Now that is what we mean when we say that
Christ will be the preparation for the blessing,
and make way for His own approach. It is as
when a great Assyrian king used to set out on
a march. He did not command the people to
make a road, but he sent on his own men, and
they cut down the trees and filled the broken
places, and levelled the mountains. So He
will, if we will let Him, be the Coming King,
the Author and Finisher of our faith.

If we would abide in Christ we must have
no confidence in self. Self-repression
must be ever the prime necessity of divine
fulness and efficiency. Now you
know how quickly you spring to the front
when any emergency arises. When something
in which you are interested comes up, you say
what you think under some sudden impulse,
and then perhaps you have weeks of taking
back your thought and taking the Lord's instead.
It is only when we get out of the way
of the Lord that He can use us. So, be out of
self, always suspending your will about everything
until you have looked at it and said:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, what is your will? What is your
thought about it?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who thus abide in Christ have the
habit of reserve and quiet; they are not rattling

an opinion about everything, and they will not
always know what they are going to do. There
will be a deferential holding back of judgment,
and walking softly with God. It is our headlong,
impulsive spirit that keeps us so constantly
from hearing and following the Lord.

be your strength or My help, but My complete

to do this requires real spiritual energy and
fixed purpose and a settled posture and habit

power in our factory. We must turn the belt
on and keep it on. The power is there, but we
must keep the connection and while we do so
the law of this higher power will work and all
the machinery will be in operation. There is
a spiritual law of choosing, believing, abiding
and holding steady in our walk with God which
is essential to the working of the Holy Ghost

calling us apart in silent and wordless

and He will give thee the desires of thine
heart,”</span> which it is, perhaps, legitimate to translate,
that not only does it mean the fulfilment
of our desires, but even the inspiration of our
desires, the inbreathing of His thoughts into
us, so that our prayers shall be in accord with
His will and so shall bring back to us the unfailing
answer of His mighty providence.

How strong is the snare of the things
that are seen, and how necessary for
God to keep us in the things that are
unseen! If Peter is to walk on the
water, he must walk; if he is going to swim, he
must swim, but he cannot do both. If the bird
is going to fly it must keep away from the
fences and the trees, and trust to its buoyant
wings. But if it tries to keep within easy reach
of the ground, it will make poor work of flying.

God had to bring Abraham to the end of his
own strength, and to let him see that in his own
body he could do nothing. He had to consider
his own body as good as dead, and then take
God for the whole work, and when he looked

He became fully persuaded that what He had
promised, He was able also to perform.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was the divine character given to
Daniel of old. It is translated in our
version, <span class="tei tei-q">“O man, greatly beloved.”</span>
But it literally means <span class="tei tei-q">“O man of desires!”</span>
This is a necessary element in all spiritual
forces. It is one of the secrets of effectual
prayer, <span class="tei tei-q">“What things soever ye desire, when
ye pray, believe that ye receive them.”</span> The
element of strong desire gives momentum to
our purposes and prayers. Indifference is an
unwholesome condition; indolence and apathy
are offensive both to God and nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And so in our spiritual life, God often has to
wake us up by the presence of trying circumstances,
and push us into new places of trust
by forces that we must subdue, or sink beneath
their power. There is no factor in prayer more
effectual than love. If we are intensely interested
in an object, or an individual, our petitions
become like living forces, and not only
convey their wants to God, but in some sense
convey God's help back to them.

May God fill us to-day with the heart of
Christ that we may glow with the Divine fire
of holy desire.

Jesus illustrates the unexpectedness of
His coming by the figure of a thief entering
a house when the master was not
there. Life, like the old Jewish night,
may be divided into three watches, youth, maturity,
old age. The summons to meet God
may come to us in either of these watches. A
writer tells us of his experience with a camping
party, of which he was a member, and
which, he tells us, always arranged to have
watches at night. <span class="tei tei-q">“We became especially careful
after what I am about to narrate happened.
During the first night, from sunset to sunrise,
we had in turn carefully guarded our camp.
But when the next night came, so impressed
were we with the orderly character of the
neighborhood, that we concluded that no guard
was needed until bedtime. Within our main
tent the evening was spent in story-telling,
singing and general amusement. When the
hour to retire arrived, it was discovered that
our other tents had been robbed and everything
of value stolen. The work was done before
we thought a guard necessary.”</span> It is
never too soon to begin watching against sin.

Great is the difference between action
and transaction. We may be constantly
acting without accomplishing anything,
but a transaction is action that
passes beyond the point of return, and becomes
a permanent committal. Salvation is a transaction
between the soul and Christ in which
the matter passes beyond recall. Sanctification
is a great transaction in which we are
utterly surrendered, irrevocably consecrated
and wholly committed to the Holy Ghost, and
then He comes and seals the transaction and
undertakes the work. Our covenant for our
Lord's healing should be just as explicit, definite
and irrevocable. And so of the covenants
to which God is leading His children from time
to time in regard to other matters of obedience
and service. God grant that during this hallowed
day many a consecrated life may be able
to say with new significance and permanence,

very likely the greatest blessing of our life lies
there. Spurgeon once said that the best evidence

a thing according to Satan's dislike for
it. Beloved, take care, lest in the very line
where your prejudices are setting you off from

not interrupt it, and prayer was not necessary

Greater than the fault you condemn

We never see all the heart. He does, and He

Nothing will more effectually arrest
the working of the Spirit in the heart
than the spirit of criticism. At the end
of a meeting a young minister came
forward and told us of the great blessing he
had received that afternoon, and the baptism of
the Holy Spirit that had come into his heart
and being, setting him free from the bondage
of years. And then he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“It all came
through your answer to that question, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Will a
criticizing spirit hinder the Holy Ghost from
filling the heart?’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the question was asked and answered, he
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was sitting in the church criticizing a
good deal that was going on, objecting to this
thing and to that thing, finding fault with the
expressions, and praises and testimonies, and
feeling thoroughly unhappy. The Lord
brought the answer home to my heart and convicted
me of my sin, and there and then I laid it
down and began to see the good instead of the
evil. Blessing fell upon me and my soul was
filled with joy and praise, and I saw where my
error lay, that for years I had been trying to
see the truth with my head instead of my heart.”</span>

One day we passed a garden. The gardener
had finished his pruning, and the
wounds of the knife and saw were beginning
to heal, while the warm April
sun was gently nourishing the stricken plant
into fresh life and energy. We thought as we
looked at that plant how cruel it would be to
begin next week and cut it down again. It
would bleed to death. Now, the gardener's
business is to revive and nourish into life. Its
business is not to die, but to live. So, we
thought, it is with the discipline of the soul.
It, too, has its dying hour; but it must not be
always dying. Rather reckon ourselves to be
dead indeed unto sin and alive unto God
through Jesus Christ our Lord Everlasting.

In the account of the healing of the Hebrew

of the touching of his ears, hands and

apart to God, and divinely endued for the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The former anointing was from the oil in
the hand of the priest, but the latter was to be
from the log, or vessel of oil itself. It was to
be literally emptied over him, until he was
bathed with all its contents.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a figure of the large and boundless baptism
of the Holy Ghost. It speaks of something

A young lady whose parents had died
while she was an infant, had been
kindly cared for by a dear friend of
the family. Before she was old enough
to know him, he went to Europe. Regularly
he wrote to her through all his years of absence,
and never failed to send her money for
all her wants. Finally word came that during
a certain week he would return and visit her.
He did not fix the day or the hour. She received
several invitations to take pleasant trips
with her friends during that week. One of
these was of so pleasant a nature that she
could not resist accepting it. During her trip,
he came, inquired as to her absence, and left.
Returning she found this note: <span class="tei tei-q">“My life has
been a struggle for you, might you not have
waited one week for me?”</span> More she never
heard, and her life of plenty became one of
want. Jesus has not fixed the day or hour of
His return, but He has said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Watch,”</span> and
should He come to-day, would He find us absorbed
in thoughtless dissipation? May we be

When the apostle speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“the deep

The beatitudes begin at the bottom of
things, the poor in spirit, the mourners, and
the hungry hearts. Suffering is essential to
profound spiritual life. We need not go to a
monastery or a leper hospital to find it. The

bring into your life the anguish of crucifixion,
unless you are born of some different race from
Adam's.

It is because men and women have not faced

Opposition is essential to a true equilibrium
of forces. The centripetal
and centrifugal forces acting in opposition
to each other keep our planet in
her orbit. The one propelling, and the other
repelling, so act and react, that instead of
sweeping off into space in a pathway of desolation
and destruction, she pursues her even orbit
around her solar center.

So God guides our lives. It is not enough
to have an impelling force—we need just as
much a repelling force, and so He holds us
back by the testing ordeals of life, by the
pressure of temptation and trial, by the things
that seem to be against us, but really are furthering
our way and stablishing our goings.
Let us thank Him for both, let us take the

confront us in the path of duty
we are to recognize them as vessels
for faith to fill with the fulness and all-sufficiency
of Jesus, and as we go forward, simply
and fully trusting Him, we may be tested, we
may have to wait and let patience have her
perfect work, but we shall surely find at last
the stone rolled away, and the Lord waiting
to render unto us double for our time of testing,
and fulfil the promise, <span class="tei tei-q">“Instead of the
thorn shall come up the fir tree, instead of the
brier the myrtle tree, and it shall be to the
Lord for an everlasting sign that shall not be
cut off.”</span>

God's very blessings become a hindrance

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christ has borne this penalty, and the same
Christ has borne the natural penalties, too, and
delivered us out of condemnation in every
sense. Physical sufferings come to us, but not
under the law of retribution, but only as a Divine
discipline. Every penalty has been fulfilled
by Christ and every law satisfied, and so
far as we can have risen with Him into the
plane of spiritual and eternal life, we are lifted
above the mere realm of law, and we enter into
the full effects of His complete satisfaction of
every claim against us. So it is true that even
the wreck that sin has brought upon our physical

atonement, and the promise is made real to us,

One of the marks of highest worth is
deep lowliness. The shallow nature,

The strong nature, conscious of its strength,

It is a simple law of nature, that air always
comes in to fill a vacuum. You
can produce a draught at any time, by
heating the air until it ascends, and then
the cold air rushes in to supply its place. And
so we can always be filled with the Holy Spirit
by providing a vacuum. This breath is dependent
upon exhausting the previous breath
before you can inhale a fresh one. And so we
must empty our hearts of the last breath of the
Holy Spirit that we have received, for it becomes
exhausted the moment we have received
it, and we need a new supply, to prevent spiritual
asphyxia.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We must learn the secret of breathing out,
as well as breathing in. Now, the breathing in
will continue if the other part is rightly done.
One of the best ways to make room for the
Holy Spirit is to recognize the needs that
come into the life as vacuums for Him to fill,
and we shall find plenty of needs all around
us to be filled, and as we pour out our lives in
holy service, He will pour His in—in full
measure.

Love is always sacrificial, and so the Christmas
spirit will call us to a glad and full surrender,
first to God, and then the joyful sacrifice
of what we call our own for His glory and
the good of others.

<span class="tei tei-q">“The Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy”</span>
(James iv. 5).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This beautiful passage has been unhappily
translated in our Revised Version:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth
to envy.”</span> It ought to be, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Spirit
that dwelleth in us loveth us to jealousy.”</span> It is
the figure of a love that suffers because of its
intense regard for the loved object.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Holy Ghost is so anxious to accomplish
in us and for us the highest will of God, and
to receive from us the truest love for Christ,
our Divine Husband, that He becomes jealous
when in any way we disappoint Him, or divide
His love with others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore, it is said in the preceding passage,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know
ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity
with God?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Oh, shall we grieve so kind a Friend? Shall
we disappoint so loving a Husband? Shall we
not meet the blessed Holy Spirit with the love
He brings us, and give in return our undivided
and unbounded affection?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Was there ever a Bridegroom so loving seeking
our heart to gain?

<span class="tei tei-q">“He sent forth the dove which returned not again
unto him”</span> (Gen. viii. 12).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, we have the dove going forth
from the ark, and finding no rest upon
the wild and drifting waste of sin and
judgment. This represents the Old
Testament period, perhaps, when the Holy
Ghost visited this sinful world, but could find
no resting-place, and went back to the bosom
of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next, we have the dove going forth and returning
with the olive leaf in her mouth, the
symbol and the pledge of peace and reconciliation,
the sign that judgment was passed and
peace was returning. Surely this may beautifully
represent the next stage of the Holy
Spirit's manifestation, as going forth in the
ministry and death of Jesus Christ, to proclaim
reconciliation to a sinful world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is a third stage, when, at length, the
dove goes forth from the ark and returns no
more; but it makes the world its home, and
builds its nest amid the habitations of men.
This is the third and present stage of the Holy
Spirit's blessed work. Let us welcome the
Dove to a nest in our hearts.

We can only know and prove the fulness
of the Spirit as we step out into
the larger purposes and plans of
Christ for the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Perhaps the chief reason why the Holy Spirit
has been so limited in His work in the hearts
of Christians, is the shameful neglect of the
unsaved and unevangelized world by the great
majority of the professed followers of Christ.
There are millions of professing Christians—and,
perhaps, real Christians—in the world,
who have never given one real, earnest thought
to the evangelization of the heathen world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God will not give the Holy Spirit in His
fulness for the selfish enjoyment of any Christian.
His power is a great trust, which we
must use for the benefit of others and for the
evangelization of the lost and sinful world.
Not until the people of God awake to understand
His real purpose for the salvation of
men, will the Church ever know the fulness of
her Pentecost. God's promised power must
lie along the line of duty, and as we obey the
command, we shall receive His promise in his
fulness.

It is probable that God lets every human
being, that crosses our path, meet us, in
order that we may have the opportunity
of leaving some blessing in his path, and
dropping into his heart and life some influence
that will draw him nearer to God. It would
be blessed, indeed, if we could meet every immortal

The early Christians regarded every situation
as an opportunity to witness for Christ.
Even when brought before kings and governors,
it never occurred to them that they were
to try to get free, but the Master's message to
them was, <span class="tei tei-q">“It shall turn to you for a testimony.”</span>
It was simply an occasion to preach
to kings and rulers, whom otherwise they

            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
